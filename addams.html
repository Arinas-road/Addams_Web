               <p>Charles Addams, was a lost soul with a troubled background who brought his pain to the pages of the New Yorker. But in reality, born in 1912 in Westfield, New Jersey, Addams grew up in a warm, loving household as the only child of devoted parents. Charles Addams drew some 1,300 New Yorker cartoons, but only 58 of them, almost all in the 1940s-50s, featured the unnamed family who remained anonymous until around the time the television show debuted.</p>

               <p>Most people assume The Addams Family started life a television series in the 1960s, but they actually appeared in a series of comic panels for The New Yorker from 1938.he based Morticia Addams’s slinky appearance on his first wife, Barbara Jean Day, whom he married in 1942 until their divorce in 1950. It started as a small story about a person who went to sell a vacuum cleaner to a strange family.</p>

               <p>Later the story got new characters. Thus Morticia got a hysband named Gomes, two kids Wednesday and Pugsley and later her mother - Maman. Wednesday name comes from a verse that was made to teach kids week days: "Who was born on Wednesday, the one who will be full of grief".</p>

               <p>“The Addams Family” had something its spiritual doppelganger couldn’t compete with: the original comics themselves, even if there were no new ones to draw from. Snooty New Yorker editor William Shawn banned Addams from the magazine during the show’s run. “The TV show wasn’t as dark as the strips, it was more zany than spooky, but it captured the flavor of what Charles Addams was doing in the New Yorker,” - says Stephen Cox.</p>

               <p>“The Addams Family” would find new life in syndication, replayed ad nauseum for decades (and still shown in 30 markets as late as 1991.) Its cult following grew, which led to all manner of ill-fated attempts to bring them back to life, including a guest spot on “The New Scooby-Doo Movies”, multiple animated series, a dreadful 1977 Halloween made-for-TV movie, and inexplicably, a dead-on-arrival pilot for a musical variety show.</p>

               <p>The Addams Family reviews were tepid, but fans ate it up to the tune of $114-million, making it the seventh-biggest U.S. hit of the year. Ironically, critics were much more enamored of the 1993 sequel—Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune called it a “valentine of venom”—but it tanked, bringing in only $49 million. </p>
